# Contributing to EEG-Controlled Wheelchair



We appreciate your contributions to improve this project! Hereâ€™s how to get involved:



## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button on GitHub to Fork your own copy.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your fork to your local machine with git clone.

3. **Create a Branch** Create a new branch for your changes (git checkout -b feature/your-feature).

4. **Do the Changes**: Apply your feature or fix to your application with code quality and documentation.

5. ** TEST YOUR CHANGES** Test the new code with the hardware set up to see if it works.

6. **Commit & Push** Commit your changes (git commit -m "Add your message") and push to your fork (git push origin: feature/your-feature).

7. **Submit a Pull Request**: create a pull request to GitHub with details of what you changed (the reason for which).



## Guidelines

- Code should be formatted in the same manner as the rest (e. g. consistent indentation in Arduino code).

- Test all changes with hardware setup(Arduino Uno, HC-05, MindWave Mobile, L298N, ZK-2WD).

- Update the `README.md` if your changes affect setup or usage instructions.

- Be respectful and collaborative in discussions.



## Areas for Contribution

- Adding obstacle detection with ultrasonic sensors.

- Improving EEG signal processing with machine learning.

- Creating a digital twin in Unreal Engine 5 for simulation.

- Enhancing documentation with wiring diagrams or demo videos.
